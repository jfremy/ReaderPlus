Reader Plus is an extension for Chrome that extends Google Reader.
It takes articles with similar titles and groups them together, only displaying the first one while letting you choose
to see the rest.

v0.23 (2012/04/28)
Details page (button in the top bar) lets you change the sensibility threshold and see how the grouping changes based on
that.
